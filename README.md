# Electric-Vehicle-EDA-project
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes and models data related to Electric Vehicles (EVs).
The goal is to understand EV adoption patterns, performance metrics, and charging infrastructure using Python and Machine Learning.

The notebook includes data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and predictive modeling.

📂 Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project contains detailed information about electric vehicles and their specifications.
Key features include:

Vehicle ID – unique identifier for each EV

Make & Model – manufacturer and model name

Model Year – production year of the vehicle

Vehicle Type – battery electric vehicle (BEV), plug-in hybrid (PHEV), etc.

Battery Capacity (kWh) – size of the EV battery

Electric Range (miles/km) – maximum distance the EV can travel on a full charge

Energy Consumption (Wh/mi or kWh/100km) – efficiency of the vehicle

Charging Level Support – availability of Level 1, Level 2, DC fast charging

State / Location – region where the EV is registered

VIN (Vehicle Identification Number) – anonymized vehicle identifier

📊 These columns allow us to analyze:

Growth of EV adoption across years

Market share by manufacturers

Trends in battery capacity and driving range

Charging infrastructure support across EVs

Regional adoption differences

🔑 Features of the Project

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing – handling missing values, standardizing formats

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – visualization of adoption trends and specs

Correlation Analysis – relationship between range, battery capacity, and efficiency

Machine Learning Models – predictions for EV adoption and performance

Insights & Conclusions – highlighting key findings in EV technology trends
